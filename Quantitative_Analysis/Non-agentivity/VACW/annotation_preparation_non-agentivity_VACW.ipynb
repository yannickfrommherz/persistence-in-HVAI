    "In this notebook, the preprocessed VACW corpus is annotated for the non-agentivity alternation, i.e., all alternating instances of passive voice constructions with \"werden\" and the impersonal pronoun \"man\" are tagged in the data. Subsequently, a dataset is prepared for modelling, i.e., all relevant variables (e.g., which variant was used in the previous slot?) from the tagged choice contexts are extracted or calculated. The resulting dataset is then combined with the data for the other two corpora and prepared for modelling in \"non-agentivity_all_corpora.ipynb\".\n",
