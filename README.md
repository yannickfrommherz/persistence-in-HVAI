# Persistence in Human-Voice Assistant Interaction

This repository **soon** contains reproducible scripts and notebooks from my doctoral thesis. Note that for data protection restrictions the corpora themselves have to be requested from Ingo Siegert. However, for comprehensibility, a small dummy dataset is supplied, allowing for certain parts of the code to be executed even without the actual data.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Code** contains all modularised scripts used in the corpora-specific Jupyter Notebooks.
- **VACC**, **VACW**, and **RBC** each contain a notebook for the respective corpus in which all data preprocessing steps (described in Chapter 4 in the doctoral thesis) as well as the persistence tagging algorithm for the qualitative analysis (Chapter 6) are executed. A small dummy dataset mimicking the VACC corpus is provided so that at least the notebook for this corpus can be run. 
- **Quantitative_Analysis** contains subfolders for the three alternation sets (Chapter 5), each comprising notebooks for annotation and data preparation, the resulting datasets (which are abstract enough to be shared) and notebooks for modelling in R.
